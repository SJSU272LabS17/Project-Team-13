******Idea 1: A mobile dashboard (android tablet) to control all connected IoT devices in the house (Reference 1)******
This dashboard should allow control of lights, toaster oven, music player, thermostat or anything else connected via wifi in the house)

Recent technology innovations allowed easier entry to hardware and software. From the development of Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Google Home we can see the emergence of IoT smart home devices. So, we decided to follow this trend and work on something related. We will build a mobile dashboard, such as an android tablet, that will allow the consumer to control all their IoT devices. We can see similar implementation in Philips Hue bulbs which use a hub to connect to the home router and act as a central bridge to connect all the bulbs. 

Different hardware devices uses different protocols and software technologies to work with within the private network. Our app will connect all these hardware devices into a single software platform and will provide a simple interface to show the user any hardware devices that are connected to their private home network. This type of software implementation has never been done and it is a challenge that we are willing to tackle.




******Idea 2: Story teller with animation******
Time parents spend with their children has high impacts toward children’s personal development. Parents understand this, and UCI research shows that today’s parents spend more time with their children compared to parents did 50 years ago (Reference 2).  We want to improve the quality of the time that the parents spend with their children. In our digital era where tablets and smartphones are ubiquitous, it is not enough for children to just listen to stories. We will create an app that will recognize and analyze what the parents read and transform this spoken story into an animation. Our plan is to use the IBM Watson speech to text library, local image gallery, and javascript to create the app that brings bedtime stories to life. 
Story time! Pick up any children’s book, and get an animation to show the child:
    Speech recognition
    Image gallery 
    Animation
    Javascript
    Bluemix
Extension: The app would be working with any book.
